# Demo: Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## Demo scenario

In this demo, you will walk through Microsoft Defender for Cloud and show how Azure Secure Score can be used to improve an organization's security posture.  NOTE: This demo walk-through assumes the presenter has admin-level permissions to the Azure subscription through an Azure pass.  An Azure subscription, such as a Cloudslice Subscription, managed by the Authorized Lab Hoster limits access and functionality so some steps below may unavailable or not show any information.

### Demo setup

In this setup task you will do some basic setup of Microsoft Defender for Cloud, to get the subscription ready and to enable and assign a default policy. Do this before you demo in front of the class. 

1. Open the browser tab, **Home-Microsoft Azure**.  If you previously closed the tab, open a browser page and in the address bar, enter portal.azure.com and sign back in.

1. In the search box, in the blue bar on the top of the page next to where it says Microsoft Azure, enter **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** then select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** from the search results.

1. If this is the first time you enter Microsoft Defender for Cloud with your subscription you may land on the Getting started page and may be prompted to upgrade.  Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **skip**.  You will be taken to the Overview page.
    1. On the top of the page, you will see a light blue information box that indicates, "Getting things ready for your subscription. This may take a few minutes..."
    1. Once the subscription is ready, a new information box will appear that says, "One subscription doesn't have the default policy assigned. To review the the list of subscriptions, open the Security Policy page."  Select the right arrow at the end of sentence.
        1. You are now in the Environment settings page. Select **Azure pass - Sponsorship**. 
        1. From the left navigation pane, select **Security policy**.
        1. From them main page, under where it says Default initiative, select **Assign policy**.
        1. From the bottom of the page, select **Review + create**.
        1. From the bottom of the page, select **Create**.
        1. From the top of the page, underneath where it says Microsoft Azure, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** from the breadcrumb, to return to the overview page.

### Demo Task

In this demo task you will do a very high-level walk-through of some of the capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

1. Information on the top of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview page includes the number of Azure subscriptions, the number of Assessed resources, the number of active recommendations, and any security alerts.  On the main body of the page there are cards representing Secure score, Regulatory compliance, Insights, and more.  

1. From the top of the page, select **Assessed resources**.  (Note that this is equivalent to having selected Inventory from the left navigation panel of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud home page).
    1. This brings you to the **Inventory** page that shows your Azure pass subscription.  Select **Azure Pass â€“ Sponsorship**.
    1. The Resource health page provides a list of recommendations.  From the available list, select **There should be more than one owner assigned to your subscription**.
    1. Select the drop-down arrow next to Remediation steps. Note how detailed remediation steps are provided along with the option to take action.  
    1. Select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** from the top-left corner of the screen to return to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview page.

1. From the top of the page, select **Active recommendations**.  (Note that this is equivalent to having selected Recommendations from the left navigation panel of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud home page).
    1. The recommendations page shows your Secure Score dashboard.
    1. Below the Secure Score dashboard are a list of controls. Each security control represents a security risk that should be mitigated and also includes information on the maximum score associated with that control, the current score, potential score increase, and resource health status.  
    1. Select one of the controls, such as **Enable MFA**.  Select one of the sub-items, such as **MFA should be enabled on accounts with owner permissions on your subscription**.  In the page that opens, you will see a description, Remediation steps, and affected resources. Exit out this page, by selecting the **X** on top-right corner of the screen.
    1. Exit the recommendations page by selecting the **X** on top-right corner of the screen, to return to the overview page.

1. You are back on the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Overview page.  From the main page, select **Regulatory compliance**. (Note that this is equivalent to having selected Recommendations from the left navigation panel of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud home page).
    1. The regulatory compliance page provides a list of compliance controls.  Under each control is a set of assessments that are based on the Azure Security Benchmark which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure.
    1. Select **IM. Identity Management** then select **IM-6 Use strong authentication controls**.  The list shows customer responsibility actions that can be taken to improve compliance posture.
    1. Select the **X** on the top-right corner of the screen to close the page and return to the regulatory compliance page.
    1. Select the **X** on the top-right corner of the screen to return to the overview page.

1. Recall that Microsoft Defender for Cloud is offered in two modes: without enhanced security features (free) and with enhanced security features which are available through the Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans. Here you discover how to enable/disable the various Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans.
    1. From the Microsoft Defender for Cloud overview page, select the **Environment settings** from the left navigation panel.
    1. Select the greater-than **>**sign next to where is say Tenant Root Group to expand it (do not select Tenant Root Group directly as that will direct you to a different page), then select **Azure Pass - Sponsorship**
    1. On the Defender plans page, notice how you can select Enable all or select individual Defender plans. Leave the settings as they are with all plans set to off.
    1. Select the **X** on the top-right corner of the screen to return to the Environment settings page.
    1. Select the **X** on the top-right corner of the screen to return to the overview page.

1. Return to the home page of the Azure portal by selecting **Home** on the top-left corner of the page.  Keep this browser tab available, as you will come back to it in a later demo.
