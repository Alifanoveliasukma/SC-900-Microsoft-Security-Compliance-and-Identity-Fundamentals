# Demo: Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)

This demo maps to the following Learn content:

- Learning Path: Describe the capabilities of Microsoft security solutions
- Module: Describe the basic security capabilities in Azure
- Unit: Describe Azure Network Security groups

## Demo scenario

In this demo, you'll explore the function of network security groups in Azure and apply an NSG to a pre-created virtual machine. You'll start by briefly showing information about the VM that was pre-created by the authorized lab hoster (ALH). Then, using an NSG that was setup as part of the pre-demo setup, you'll show the essential parameters of an NSG and the default inbound and outbound rules. You'll assign a VM interface to the NSG, create a new RDP rule to allow connection to the VM, and finally you'll test it.

### Demo part 1

In this part, you'll view some of the parameters associated with the VM that that was created as part of the setup demo (DEMO_00_pre_demo_setup.md).

1. Open Microsoft Edge.  In the address bar, enter **portal.azure.com**.

1. Sign in with your admin credentials.
    1. In the Sign-in window, enter the username provided by your lab hosting provider then select **Next**.
    1. Enter the admin password that should be provided by your lab hosting provider. Select **Sign in**.
    1. If prompted to stay signed- in, select **Yes**.

1. In the blue search box at the page, enter **Virtual Machines** then select **Virtual Machines** from the search results.

1. From the Virtual machines page, select the VM listed **SC900-WinVM**.  This VM should have been created as part of the pre-demo setup.  If its not listed, create it now.

1. You're now in the SC900-WinVM page.  Note some of the basic information about the VM.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Networking**.  
    1. The default view is for inbound port rules.  Note that the network interface for this VM has no network security groups configured.  The same is true if you select Outbound port rules.
    1. Select **Effective security rules** next to where it says Network interface.  Note that it says, "No network security groups or applications security groups are associated with the network interface".

1. Note to presenter, If you were to try check port status on the connect page, you get the message "Cannot verify".  This does not necessarily mean that the ports are not exposed.  As you will note when you take the same action with NSG assigned you get "Not accessible" indicating that traffic on that port is blocked.


1. Leave this browser tab open.

### Demo part 2

In this part, you'll assign an interface to the NSG, you'll speak to the default inbound and outbound rules showing how the rules work.  As part of the pre-demo setup, a VM should, assign the network interface of the VM to that NSG, and create a new inbound rule for RDP traffic.

1. Open a new browser tab to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com) and in the blue search bar on the top of the page, enter **Network security groups** groups. From the results, select **Network security groups** (do not select Network security groups classic).

1. Select the NSG created as part of the pre-demo setup. If you did not previously create it, do so now. Select **Create network security group** and specify the following settings:
    1. Subscription:  Leave the default value (this is the Azure subscription provided by the authorized lab hoster)
    1. Resource group:  **LabsSC900** (the same resource group used by the VM).
    1. Name:  **NSG-SC900**
    1. Region:  leave the default.
    1. Select **Review + create** then select **Create**.
    1. Once the deployment is complete (this happens very quickly), select **Go to resource**.

1. On the top of the page underneath where it says Essentials, you'll see some basic information about the NSG you created.  Two points to note are that there are no CUSTOM Security rules and there are no subnets nor network interfaces associated with this NSG.  Although there are no custom security rules, there are default inbound and outbound rules that are included with every NSG, as shown on the page.  Review both the inbound and outbound rules. The default inbound rules deny all inbound traffic that is not from a virtual network or an Azure load balancer.  The outbound rules deny all outbound traffic except traffic between virtual networks and outbound traffic to the internet.

1. From the left navigation pane of the NSG-SC900 page, under Settings, select **Network interfaces**.
    1. Select **Associate**.
    1. In the field for selecting network interface associations, select the **drown-down arrow**, select **sc900-winvmXXX**, then select **ok** on the bottom of the window. Once the interface is associated to the NSG, it will show up on the list.

1. Return the VM by selecting the browser tab for the VM.  You should see that there is now an NSG attached to the VM interface.  The inbound port rules table is displayed. The default inbound rules deny all inbound traffic that is not from a virtual network or an Azure load balancer.  To test this, you'll check the status on the RDP port, 3389.
    1. From the top of the page, select **Connect** then select **Check access** for port 3389 (RDP), you will see "Not accessible".  
    1. Although you are only testing against the RDP port 3389, all inbound network traffic that is not from another virtual network or load balancer is blocked.  

1. Now you will create a rule to allow inbound traffic on the RDP port.  From the left navigation pane, select **Networking**. The Inbound port rules table should be displayed (the inbound port rules tab is underlined).  From the right side of the page, select **Add inbound port rule**. An important point to call out is that you cannot remove the default rules, but you can override them by creating rules with higher priorities. On the Add inbound security rule window, specify the following settings:
    1. Source:  **Any**
    1. Source port ranges: **\***
    1. Destination:  **Any**
    1. Service:  **RDP**
    1. Action:  **Allow**
    1. Priority:  **1000**; Note: rules with lower numbers have higher priority and are processed first.
    1. Name:  Leave the default name or create your own descriptive name.
    1. Note the warning sign at the bottom of the page.  We're using RDP to only for testing purposes and to demonstrate the functionality of the NSG.
    1. Select **Add**

1. Once the rule is provisioned, it will appear on the list of inbound rules (you may need to refresh the screen).

### Demo part 3

With the NSG  associated to your VM and the RDP rule created, you'll show the impact of the NSG by testing RDP connectivity to the VM.

1. Open the SC900-WinVM â€“ Microsoft Azure Tab on your browser. 

1. Select **Connect** from the left navigation panel.
    1. You can simply select **check access**.  The status should show as "Accessible". Alternatively, if you have time you can connect to the VM by opening an instance of Remote Desktop Connection on Windows.  This option will open the VM upon successfully connecting to it.  Listed below are the steps:
        1. On your Windows search bar, enter **Remote desktop connection** then select **Open**.
        1. In the field next to where it says **Computer**, enter the public IP address of your VM.
        1. Once you enter the IP address, the user name should appear below the field where you entered the IP address. If not, then expand **Show Options** and enter the user name for your VM, then select **Connect**.
        1. A Remote Desktop connection window opens indicating, The identity of the remote computer cannot be verified. Do you wish to connect anyway? Select **Yes**.
        1. You're now connected to the VM. highlight to the learner that in this case you were able to connect to the VM because the inbound traffic rule you created allows inbound traffic to the VM via RDP.
        1. Minimize the VM, by selecting the underscore **_** in the blue tab that shows the VM's IP address. This brings you back to the SC900-WinVM | Connect page.

1. From the left navigation panel select **Networking** then from the main window, select **Outbound port rules**.  Speak to the default outbound rules. The default rules allow outbound VNet traffic from any virtual network to any other virtual network and allows outbound internet traffic. Any other type of outbound traffic is denied.  You cannot remove the default rule, but you can override it by creating a rule with higher priority in the same way you created an inbound rule.

1. If your timer permits and you wish to show similar steps for outbound traffic go through the optional demo part listed below.  Otherwise exit out of the VM, but keep the Azure tab open on your browser for the next demo.

### OPTIONAL Demo part 4

In this part, you will show the current NSG outbound rules allow outbound internet traffic, from the VM.  Then you will create a rule to block outbound internet traffic from the VM,  Finally, you will show the impact of the newly created rule by attempting to access the internet from the VM.

1. Open the VM that you minimized in the previous step. Here you will show outbound internet connectivity to the Internet, which is enabled by one of the default outbound rules. Once the VM opens and you logged in as a user, select **Microsoft Edge** to open the browser.  Since this is the first time you open Microsoft Edge, you may get a pop-up window, select **Start without your data**, then select **Continue without this data**, then select **Confirm and start browsing**.
    1. Enter **www.bing.com** in the browser address bar and confirm you're able to connect to the search engine.
    1. Once you've confirmed that you can access www.bing.com, close the browser window in the VM, but leave the VM up.

1. Minimize the VM, by selecting the underscore **_** in the blue tab that shows the VM's IP address. This brings you back to the SC900-WinVM | Connect page.  

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Networking**.

1. Select the **Outbound port rules** tab.  You'll see the default outbound rules.  Note the default rule "AllowInternetOutBound". This rule allows all outbound internet traffic. You cannot remove the default rule, but you can override it by creating a rule with higher priority. From the right side of the page, select **Add outbound port rule**.

1. On the Add outbound security rule page, specify the following settings:
    1. Source:  **Any**
    1. Source port ranges:  **\***
    1. Destination:  **Service Tag**
    1. Destination service tag:  **Internet**
    1. Service:  **Custom** (leave the default)
    1. Destination port ranges:  * (be sure to put an asterisk in the destination port ranges field)
    1. Protocol: **Any**
    1. Action: **Deny**
    1. Priority:  **1000**
    1. Name:  Leave the default name or create your own descriptive name.
    1. Select **Add**

1. Once the rule is provisioned, it will appear on the list of outbound rules.  Although it appears on the list, it will take a few minutes to take effect (wait a few minutes before continuing with the next steps).  

1. Return to your VM (the icon for the VM should be shown on the task bar on the bottom of the page).

1. Open the Microsoft Edge browser in your VM and enter **www.bing.com**. The page should not display.  Note: if you're able to connect to the internet and you verified that all the parameters for the outbound rule were properly set, it's likely because it takes a few minutes for the rule to take effect.  Close the browser, wait a few minutes and try again.  Note:  Azure subscriptions in the lab environment may experience longer than normal delays.

1. Close the remote desktop connection, by selecting the **X** on the top center of the page where the IP address is shown.  A pop-up window appears indicating Your remote session will be disconnected. Select **OK**.

1. Keep the Azure tab open on your browser for the next demo.

### Review

In this demo, you showed the information and settings associated an NSG, including the process to associate an interface to the NSG, you showed the default inbound and outbound rules, and finally the steps to create a new rule.
