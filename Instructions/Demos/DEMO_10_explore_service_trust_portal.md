1. A pop-up window may appear with the option to receive email notifications when documents that are saved to your library are updated.  In this case, you don’t need to receive any notifications of updates, so leave the defaults and select **Save**.  The document is still saved to your library.

1. Now verify that the document is in fact in your library. Scroll up to get to get back to the top of page. From the top navigation, select **My Library**.  If you don’t see the option for My Library, select More, then select My Library.

1. From the top of the Service Trust Portal page, select **Trust Documents** and note the options. Explore the information available for each of the links under Trust Documents. Selecting Audit Reports directs you to the same location that you explored in the previous steps (different way to get to the same content).
